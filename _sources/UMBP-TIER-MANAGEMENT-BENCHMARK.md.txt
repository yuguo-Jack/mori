# UMBP Distributed Tier-Management Benchmark

`umbp_tier_bench` runs deterministic synthetic or recorded workloads through an
in-process Master and one or more PoolClients. It measures the distributed UMBP
PUT/GET path, including routing, named backend placement, peer-local offload,
payload validation, throughput, latency, and backend capacity.

## Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_UMBP=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build --target \
  umbp_tier_bench test_umbp_workload_trace test_umbp_workload_runner
```

The benchmark is a manual target and is not run by plain `ctest`.

## Run, generate, and replay

Run a workload against the default topology, one DRAM backend per peer:

```bash
./build/src/umbp/umbp_tier_bench run \
  --profile mixed --clients 4 --operations 10000 --keys 2000 \
  --read-ratio 0.7 --min-value-bytes 4096 --max-value-bytes 4096 \
  --qps 20000 --backend-capacity 2GiB
```

Generate a reusable trace and replay it under a policy:

```bash
./build/src/umbp/umbp_tier_bench generate \
  --trace workload.umbptrace --profile hotset --seed 42 \
  --operations 100000 --keys 10000 --clients 8 --qps 50000

./build/src/umbp/umbp_tier_bench replay \
  --trace workload.umbptrace --config policy.json
```

Use `umbp_tier_bench <subcommand> --help` for the complete option list.

## JSON backend and tier policy

Anything beyond one DRAM backend per peer — several backends, other media,
weights, logical tiers, watermarks — is described by `--config`, which is the
same policy format the product reads:

```bash
./build/src/umbp/umbp_tier_bench run \
  --config examples/umbp/multi_backend_policy.json \
  --profile capacity-pressure --operations 1000 --page-size 2MiB
```

That file is the complete example: HBM in front of DRAM and two SSDs, three
tiers, weighted members. The `umbp_backend_policy_config` test loads it, so the
example and the parser cannot drift apart. A single tier from it, which is where
the placement and migration knobs live:

```json
{
  "name": "warm",
  "backends": { "dram": 70, "ssd_a": 30 },
  "offload_to": ["cold"],
  "offload_trigger": "watermark",
  "high_watermark": 0.9,
  "low_watermark": 0.7
}
```

New PUTs use `entry_tier` (the first tier when omitted) and its deterministic
backend weights. `NO_SPACE` recursively spills through `offload_to`; every
destination tier applies its own weights.
`on_evict` copies the key to the first available target before deleting its
source copy. `watermark` queues asynchronous LRU offload after aggregate tier
use reaches `high_watermark`. Migration continues toward `low_watermark` and
retries transient failures with bounded backoff.

`promote_trigger` says when a tier sends a key back up, mirroring
`offload_trigger`: `never` (the default), `on_read` on the first hit, or
`on_hits` once `promote_hits` reads have been served for that key from this
tier. `promote_hits` is required by `on_hits`, rejected by the others, and must
be at least 2 — a threshold of 1 is `on_read`. The entry tier may not declare a
trigger, having no upstream tier to promote into. `promote_mode` decides whether
the promoted key is copied or moved; under `move` the source tier is reclaimed
when the master next names that key as an eviction victim, not at promotion time,
because the delete defers behind the read lease the triggering read holds.

Backend and logical-tier names must be unique, and every backend must belong to
exactly one logical tier. Offload targets may name a backend or logical tier
and must resolve to a later tier, which makes the
topology acyclic. A multi-device HBM definition expands to one backend per
device while preserving the logical backend's aggregate weight and capacity.
The current per-peer limit is eight concrete backends.

Production distributed clients may set
`UMBPDistributedConfig::backend_policy_path`; Python exposes the same
`backend_policy_path` property. Distributed-backed standalone servers also
accept `UMBP_BACKEND_POLICY`.

Each benchmark run prints `backend_placement` and `tier_transitions` CSV
sections. Production clients can record successful PUT/GET traffic with
`UMBP_WORKLOAD_TRACE_PATH`; replay it with payload validation disabled because
production payload bytes are not embedded in the trace.

**Page size vs value size.** Each value occupies one or more whole pages. The
defaults (`page_size=2MiB`, `backend_capacity=256MiB`) only hold 128 one-page
keys per backend. A 4KiB value still consumes 2MiB. For small-value policy
sweeps use `--page-size 64KiB --backend-capacity 2GiB` (or size capacity as
`page_size * key_count`).

**GET affinity.** Synthetic PUT/GET pairs for one key stay on one client
stream. `--affinity none` plus `--get-strategy local` can still miss: Master
`most_available` may place the PUT on another node, and the producing client's
local GET then waits out the publication retry. For GET-heavy same-client
profiles use `--affinity local`. To exercise the remote RDMA path, PUT from
one client and GET from another (see `test_umbp_tier_benchmark`).

**RDMA QP depth.** `mori_io` defaults `max_send_wr=8192`. On some mlx5 devices
that depth times SGE/inline exceeds the per-QP work-queue budget, so
`ibv_create_qp` returns EINVAL even though `max_qp_wr` is larger. Set a smaller
depth before running multi-client benchmarks or integration tests:

```bash
export MORI_IO_QP_MAX_SEND_WR=1024
export MORI_IO_QP_MAX_CQE=4096
```

Also set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the build tree (`build/src/application:build/src/io:build/src/metrics`)
when running binaries from `build/`.

**SSD.** A value may span several contiguous staging pages. It must fit the
arena (`page_size * staging_pages`); committed SSD capacity is charged by the
value's actual bytes. `max_allocatable_bytes` is
`min(available_bytes, staging_arena_bytes)`.

The workload controls are profile, seed, operation and key counts, minimum and
maximum value size, value-size distribution, read ratio, client count, batch
size, and QPS. Cluster controls select DRAM, HBM, or SSD; backend count,
capacity, and page size; single or weighted placement; and Master put strategy,
affinity, and get strategy.

`run` defaults to max-throughput scheduling. `replay` defaults to open-loop
scheduling using trace timestamps. `--time-scale` scales those timestamps, and
`--max-throughput` ignores them while preserving order within each client.
Different clients execute concurrently.

`--settle-ms` controls both the registration and post-run heartbeat settle.
Master eviction uses production defaults.

## Synthetic profiles

- `sequential`: write-only traversal of the key space.
- `uniform`: uniformly selected keys with the configured read ratio.
- `hotset`: Zipf-distributed access within the default hot set.
- `read-after-write`: alternating PUT and GET for the same key.
- `mixed`: deterministic key traversal with the configured read ratio.
- `capacity-pressure`: non-repeating writes intended to exceed capacity.

Random choices and values are derived from the seed. UMBP keys are immutable:
repeated logical writes create versioned keys, and reads target the latest
version. Each key's dependency chain stays on one client stream.

## Trace contract

Trace files start with the versioned `UMBPTRCE` envelope and contain
length-delimited protobuf records defined in
`src/umbp/distributed/proto/umbp_workload.proto`: one
`WorkloadTraceHeader`, followed by zero or more `WorkloadEvent` records.

The header records the schema version, nanosecond time unit, payload seed, and
all synthetic generation settings. Events record relative time, client id,
operation id, PUT/GET kind, key, value size, and batch id. Readers reject
unsupported versions and malformed records.

Payload bytes are omitted. PUT data is generated from
`(key, operation_id, seed)`, and GET data can be checked against the same
sequence. Disable checking with `--no-payload-validation` when replaying a
future externally recorded trace without payload identity.

Successful PUTs flush heartbeat publication. A GET for a key produced by the
same run retries for a fixed five seconds while that publication is pending, so
asynchronous Master visibility is not reported as a storage miss.

## Results

The `summary` CSV section reports aggregate operation and byte counts,
failures, misses, validation failures, wall time, throughput, latency
percentiles, and scheduling lag.

After the measured interval and heartbeat settle, `backend_placement` reports
each node/backend's tier, owned key count, total and available capacity, and
maximum allocatable block. Placement inspection is outside the timed region and
uses side-effect-free backend counters.

For policy comparisons, retain the trace and change only topology or routing
arguments. Keep the settle interval, heartbeat environment, and hardware
configuration identical.
